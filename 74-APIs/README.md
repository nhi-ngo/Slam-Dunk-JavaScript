# 74 - APIs

## Notes

Great explanation by Chris Hoffman from [HowToGeek](https://www.howtogeek.com/343877/what-is-an-api/).

Think of API as the messenger that delivers your request to the provider that youâ€™re requesting it from and then the provider delivers the response back to you.

In order to pull data from a website, that website has to offer what is called an API. Thinking about a Google Maps object embedded on a website, that website is using the Google Maps API to embed that map. Google exposes this APIs to web developers, who can then use the APIs to embed objects right on their website.
